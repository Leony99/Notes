## Abstract class

An abstract Java class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, you cannot create objects from it using the `new` operator. It serves as a "base" or "mold" to other classes, defining a common behavior that their subclasses should follow or implement.

Subclasses of an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods of it.

```java
//Class declaration
public abstract class Person {
    public void speak(){
        System.out.print("Hello World!");
    }

    public abstract void eat();
}
```
