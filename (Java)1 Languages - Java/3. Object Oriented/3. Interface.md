## Interface

Interface in Java is a type of "contract" that defines a set of methods that a class should implement. It is totally abstract by nature.

Unlike a class, an interface cannot be instantiated directly and is used to specify what a class should do, but not how it should do.

```java
//Inteface declaration
public interface Bottle {
    void openBottle();
    void closeBottle();
}
```
