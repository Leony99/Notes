## Static elements

The Static keyword is used to create elements (variables, methods, blocks and classes) that belong to the class itself, not a specific instance of the class. This means that they can be accessed directly by the class without the need to create an object.

```java
class Class {
    static int counter = 0;

    Increment() {
        counter++;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class obj1 = new Increment();
        Class obj2 = new Increment();
        System.out.println("Counter: " + Class.counter); // Output = Counter: 2
    }
}
```

## static class

An inner static class is a static class defined within another class. Unlike an ordinary (non -static) Inner Class, it does not have access to the external class instance members, as it is not associated with a specific external class instance. It can only access static members of the external class.

```java
class External {
    private static int x = 10;

    static class InnerStatic {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Value of x: " + x);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        External.InnerStatic inner = new External.InnerStatic();
        inner.show();
    }
}
```
