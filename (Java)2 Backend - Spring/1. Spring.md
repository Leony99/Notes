## Spring

Spring is an open source framework for Java that simplifies the development of robust, scalable and easy to maintain applications. It was created to solve common problems in Java projects, such as object management, component configuration, and technologies integration (databases, web APIs, etc.). Instead of writing repetitive or complex code, Spring offers ready to use tools.
