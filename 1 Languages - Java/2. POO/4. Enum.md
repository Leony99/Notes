## Enum

It is a special type of `class that represents a fixed set of constants`. It is used to define not change collections, such as days of the week, months of the year, states of a process, etc.

```java
enum DaysOfweek {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DayOfWeek today = DaysOfweek.MONDAY;
        System.out.println("Today is " + today);
    }
}
```

```java	
enum DaysOfweek {
    SUNDAY("Sunday");
    MONDAY("Monday"),
    TUESDAY("Tuesday"),
    WEDNESDAY("Wednesday"),
    THURSDAY("Thursday"),
    FRIDAY("Friday"),
    SATURDAY("Saturday"),

    private String description;

    DaysOfweek(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DaysOfweek today = DaysOfweek.MONDAY;
        System.out.println("Today is " + today.getDescription());
    }
}
```

```java
enum Operation {
    SUM {
        @Override
        public int calculate(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    },
    SUBTRACTION {
        @Override
        public int calculate(int a, int b) {
            return a - b;
        }
    };

    public abstract int calculate(int a, int b);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + Operation.SUM.calculate(5, 3));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + Operation.SUBTRACTION.calculate(5, 3));
    }
}
```
