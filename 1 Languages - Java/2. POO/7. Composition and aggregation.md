## Composition and aggregation (has-a)

Composition - Subclasses depends on the parent class to exist.
Aggregation - Classes do not depend on each other to exist.

```java
//Parent class
public class PersonalComputer {
    private Processor processor;
    private GraphicsCard graphicsCard;

    public PersonalComputer(Processor processor, GraphicsCard graphicsCard) {
        this.processor = processor;
        this.graphicsCard = graphicsCard;
    }
}
```

```java
//Child class
public class Processor {
    private String brand;
    private String series;
    private int generation;
    private int cores;
    private int threads;
    private String cacheMemory;
    private String frequency;

    public Processor() {
    }

    public Processor(String frequency, int cores, String cacheMemory,
                     int threads, int generation,
                     String series, String brand) {
        this.frequency = frequency;
        this.cores = cores;
        this.cacheMemory = cacheMemory;
        this.threads = threads;
        this.generation = generation;
        this.series = series;
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}
```
