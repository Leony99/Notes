## Encapsulation

Hide the internal state of an object and only expose what is necessary, `restricting direct access to some of object's components`, which is achieved using access modifiers like private, public, protected, and default.

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;

    public setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0 || age <= 120) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
```

```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setAge(-20); //Age can't be negative
    }
}
```
