## Comparable and Comparator

Comparable and Comparator are two key interfaces that are essential for sorting and ordering objects, especially when working with collections like ArrayList, TreeSet, or methods from the Collections class (e.g., Collections.sort()).

## Comparable

Comparable<T> is an interface in the java.lang package that defines a natural ordering for objects of a class.

**Key method:**

`compareTo(T o)`: Compares the current object (this) with another object (o) of the same type.

```java
String x = "A";
String y = "a";

int result = x.compareTo(y);
```

**Returns:**

- Negative integer (< 0) if this is less than o.
- Zero (0) if this equals o.
- Positive integer (> 0) if this is greater than o.

## Comparator

Comparator<T> is an interface in the java.util package that allows you to define custom ordering for objects.

**Key method:**

`compare(T o1, T o2)`: Compares two objects (o1 and o2)

**Returns:**

- Negative integer (< 0) if o1 is less than o2.
- Zero (0) if o1 equals o2.
- Positive integer (> 0) if o1 is greater than o2
