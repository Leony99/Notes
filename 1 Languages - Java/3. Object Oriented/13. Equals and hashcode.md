## Equals method

The Equals method is used to determine if two objects are "equal" in terms of content or meaning, going beyond the simple comparison of references (which is made with the operator ==).

In default implementation, Equals only checks whether the references of both objects are equal (ie, they point to the same memory address). See a basic example:

```java
Person obj1 = new Person("John", 25);
Person obj2 = new Person("John", 25);
System.out.println(obj1.equals(obj2)); // false, because they are different objects
```

However, in personalized classes, we usually want to compare the content of objects, not just their references. For this, we stand out the Equals method. For example, in a person class:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person other = (Person) obj;
        return age == other.age && name.equals(other.name);
    }
}
```

```java
Person obj1 = new Person("John", 25);
Person obj2 = new Person("John", 25);
System.out.println(obj1.equals(obj2)); // True, because they have the same content
```

## HashCode method

The hashcode method returns an integer value (a "hash code") that represents the object. It is mainly used in hash based data structures, such as hashmap and hashset, to determine which "bucket" the object will be stored. In the default implementation of the Object class, it usually returns a value based on the object's memory address:

```java	
Person obj1 = new Person("John", 25);
Person obj2 = new Person("John", 25);
System.out.println(obj1.hashCode ==  obj2.hashCode); // False, because they are different objects
```

When you override `equals`, it is also essential to override `hashCode` to ensure that objects considered equal by equals have the same hash value. This is a rule of the Hashcode contract in Java:

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    int result = 17;
    result = 31 * result + name.hashCode();
    result = 31 * result + age;
    return result;
}
```

```java
Person obj1 = new Person("John", 25);
Person obj2 = new Person("John", 25);
System.out.println(obj1.hashCode ==  obj2.hashCode); // True, because they have the same content
```
