# Responsivity

Tailwind facilitates responsive development with a mobile-first approach. It uses breakpoints which are applied as prefixes to adjust styles on different screen widths.

## Breakpoints

- sm = 640px
- md = 768px
- lg = 1024px
- xl = 1280px
- 2xl = 1536px

*Example:*

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 sm:p-8 md:p-16 lg:p-24 xl:p-32">
  Responsive padding
</div>
```
