## JSP and Servlet

**Servlet** is a Java class that runs on the server side and is used to process requests and generate dynamic responses to web applications. It is part of the Java Servlet API, which is a specification of the Java EE platform (today Jakarta EE). Servlets are executed within a web container (such as Tomcat or Jetty) and are responsible for dealing with HTTP requests such as Get, Post, etc.

A servlet receives a requisition (HttpServletRequest), processes data (business logic, database access, etc.) and sends an answer (HttpServletResponse), usually in HTML format or other type of data (JSON, XML, etc.).

**JSP** is a technology that allows you to create HTML based dynamic web pages, but with the capacity to embed Java code directly on the file. It is built on Servlets: At the bottom, a JSP file is converted into a servlet by the web container before it is executed.

## Web Container

**Web container**, or servlet container is a software component responsible for managing the execution of Java-based web applications such as Servlets and JSPS. It is part of a web server or works in conjunction with it.
