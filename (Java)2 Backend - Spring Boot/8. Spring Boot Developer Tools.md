## Spring Boot Developer Tools

`Spring-Boot-Devtools` is an optional dependency on Spring Boot designed to improve productivity during development, offering tools such as application automatic restart when detecting code changes (without the need to recompile manually), automatic resource reload in the web browser via LiveReload, and optimized settings to the local environment, such as disabling template caches.

It does not add functionality to the application in production, and is usually configured with <scope>runtime</scope> and <optional>True</optional> in `pom.xml` to avoid its inclusion in final builds, making the development cycle faster and more efficient for developers.
