## Spring Boot Starter Parent

The `spring-boot-starter-parent` is not a common dependency like the others (which you add to the `<Dependencies>` section), but a "parent POM" (Project Object Model) that you define in the `<parent>` section of your `pom.xml`.

When you create a project on Spring Initializr (the official Spring Boot tool), it includes `Spring-Boot-Starter-Parent` by default in `Pom.xml` generated, unless you choose another option (e.g., gradle or a customized Pom).

It acts as a base for Spring Boot projects, providing standard settings such as UTF-8 coding and Java version, as well as managing dependencies and plugins versions (e.g., spring-boot-maven-plugin), ensuring compatibility between libraries without the developer having to specify versions manually; It does not bring modules or notes directly, but facilitates the integration of other starters.
