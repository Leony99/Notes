## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a Java based development framework that simplifies the creation of robust and scalable applications. It is an extension of the Spring ecosystem, designed to accelerate the configuration and development process, eliminating much of the complexity associated with the manual configuration of Java projects.

## Characteristics

- **Automatic Configuration**: Spring Boot automatically sets the application components based on the dependencies you add to the project (via maven or gradle). For example, if you include the Spring Web module, it automatically configures an embedded server such as Tomcat.
- **Starters**: These are sets of pre-configured dependencies that make it easier to add features. For example, `Spring-Boot-Starter-Web` brings everything you need to create a Restful Web application.
- **Embedded servers**: Includes servers like Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow, eliminating the need to manually deploy WARs on an external server.
- **"Production-Ready"**: offers ready-made resources such as monitoring, metrics and health management via Spring Boot actor.
- **Without XML**: Unlike traditional spring, Spring Boot prioritizes setting via notes and Java code, reducing XML file dependence.

## Project creation

- Configure your IDE:
  - VSCode: Install `Spring Boot Extension Pack` and `Extension Pack for Java`.
- Use the Spring Initializr to create a new project: <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Boot Initializr</a>

## File structure

**src/main/java:** Contains Java packages with the source code.

- `MyProjectApplication.java`: main class with the Main method that boots the spring boot.
- `Controller/`: Rest API layer, where you define endpoints.
- `Service/`: business logic.
- `Repository/`: Access to the database (usually using Spring Data JPA).
- `Model/`: Entities that represent the data (Classes mapped to database tables).
- `config/`: specific project settings.
- `Exception/`: Custom Exceptions.

**src/main/resources:**

- `Application.Properties`: Configuration file (Database connection, server port...).
- `Static/`: Publicly accessible files (CSS, JS, etc.).
- `Templates/`: For template engines like Thymeleaf (if used).

**src/test:** Contains Java packages with unit and integration tests.

- `MyProjectApplicationTests.java`: Test class.

`pom.xml` or `build.gradle`: Build file to manage dependencies and compile the project.
