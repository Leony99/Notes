# useRef

Ref lets a component “remember” a value, the value is remembered even across renders.

When the value changes, the component is not re-rendered. It occurs because React does not monitor changes to useRef for re-rendering purposes. The value stored in useRef can be changed but the component's UI remains the same.

useRef returns a ref object with a single 'current' property initially set to the initial value you provided.

```jsx
const refName = useRef(initialValue)
```

*Example:*

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  // ...
}
```

## DOM Refs

It’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.

- Declare a ref object with an initial value of null;
- Pass your ref object as the ref attribute to the JSX of the DOM node;
- React will set the **current** property of your ref object to that DOM node;
- Now you can access the element’s DOM node and call methods.

```jsx
const refName = useRef(null)
```

```jsx
<Element ref={refName} />
```

```jsx
refName.current.method()
```

*Example:*

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  
  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <input ref={inputRef} />;
  )
}
```
