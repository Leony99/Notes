# Class components

Before React 16.8(when Hooks were introduced), class components were the main way to define components that needed local state or lifecycle methods. While functional components are now more popular due to hooks, class components are still used in many existing codebases.

**constructor()**: Is a special method used to initialize an instance of the component. 
It's used to pass props for the parent(React.Component), initialize the component's state and bind methods to the component instance.

**render()**: Every class component must have a render() method. This method returns the JSX that will be rendered in the browser. It re-renders when the state or props change.

*Example:*

```jsx
import { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            name: 'John Doe',
            age: 33
        };

        this.handleNameChange = this.handleNameChange.bind(this);
    }

    handleNameChange = (e) => {
        this.setState({
            name: 'John Snow'
        });
    }

    render() {
        return(
            <p>Name: {this.state.name}, age: {this.state.age}</p>
        )
    }
}
```
