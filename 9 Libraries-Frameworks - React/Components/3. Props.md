# Props

React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

The props you can pass to a default HTML tag are predefined. But you can pass any props to your own components

*Example:*

```jsx
export default function ParentComponent {
    return(
        <ChildComponent parameter={parameterValue} />
    )
}
```
```jsx
export default function ChildComponent(props) {
    return <h1>{props.parameter}</h1>;
}
```

Props is an object that contains all the props passed to the component. You can access the props by using props.propKey. Or you can use destructuring to get the value of a prop.

*Example:*

```jsx
export default function ChildComponent({ parameter }) {
    return <h1>{parameter}</h1>;
}
```
