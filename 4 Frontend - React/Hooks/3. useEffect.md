# useEffect

Is a fundamental tool for handling side effects in functional components. It lets you perform side effects like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and timers.

The side effects are executed when at least one dependency in the dependencies list are changed.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {}, dependencies?);
```

*Example:*

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();

    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
```

##  Dependencies

useEffect runs after the first render and after every render that called by a listed dependency change. If there is no dependency, useEffect will run after every render. If there is a list, but it’s empty, useEffect will run after the initial render.

- No dependency: run after every render.
- Empty dependency list: run after the initial render.
- Dependency list: run after the initial render and every render that called by the listed dependency change.

## External System

useEffect is used to synchronize a component with an external system. If you’re not trying to synchronize with some external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.
