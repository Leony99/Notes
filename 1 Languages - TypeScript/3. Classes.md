# Classes

TypeScript offers full support for the class keyword. Adding type annotations and other syntax to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}

const john = new Person('John', 25);
```

## Shorthand constructor

You can use the shorthand constructor syntax to define a constructor for a class.

*Example:*

```TypeScript	
class Person {
  constructor(
    name: string, 
    age: number) {}
}

const john = new Person('John', 25);
```

## Class modifiers

Class modifiers are keywords that can be used to modify the behavior of a class.

- readonly: A property that cannot be changed.
- protected: A property that can only be accessed inside the class and derived classes.
- private: A property that can only be accessed inside the class.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
class Person {
  readonly name: string;
  protected age: number;
  private id: number | string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, id: number | string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.id = id;
  }
}
```

## Class + Interface

You can use interfaces to define the shape of an object, and then use the class keyword to create an actual implementation of that interface.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  sayHello(): string;
}

class PersonImpl implements Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}
```
