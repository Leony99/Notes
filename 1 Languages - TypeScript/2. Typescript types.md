# Typescript types

In typescript you have new types:

- Typescript types:
    - any
    - tuple
    - enum
    - type
    - interface
    - Union
    - Intersection

## Any

Any is a type that represents any value.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
const x: any = 10;
```

## Tuple

A special form of array that allows you to define a fixed number of elements with specific types for each position.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
const person: [string, number] = ['John', 10];
const [firstName, lastName]: [string, string] = ['John', 'Doe'];
```

## Enum

Allows you to define a set of named values. Enums are useful when you need to work with a fixed group of values ​​and want to give them readable names.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
enum Color {
  Red = "red",
  Green = "green",
  Blue = "blue",
}

let color: string = Color.Red;
```


## Type

'type' is a keyword in TypeScript used to create type aliases or custom types.

*Examples:*

```TypeScript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent: boolean;
  address?: string; // Optional property(string or undefined)
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
}
```
```TypeScript
type ID = string | number;
type Order = {
    productID: ID;
    productName: string;
}

type User = {
  id: ID;
  name: string;
  orders: Order[];
}
```
```TypeScript	
type Direction = "north" | "south" | "east" | "west";

type Compass = {
  direction: Direction;
}
```

## Interface

An interface is a blueprint for creating objects.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  readonly age: number; // readonly = cannot be changed
  isStudent: boolean;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
}
```

## Union

A union represents a value that can be one of several types. It allows a variable to hold values of different types, but only one at a time.

*Example:*

```TypeScript
const id: number | string = 10;
```

## Intersection

A intersection combines multiple types into one. A value of an intersection type must satisfy all the types it intersects. This is particularly useful when you want to create objects that have properties from multiple types.

*Example:*

```TypeScript	
type Person = {
  name: string;
}

type Employee = {
  employeeId: number;
}

type PersonEmployee = Person & Employee;

const john: PersonEmployee = {
  name: "John Doe",
  employeeId: 123
};
```
