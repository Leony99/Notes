# API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that allows different systems, software or applications to communicate with each other. In simple terms, an API is like a "bridge" that connects one software to another, allowing them to exchange data or services.

## How it works

An API defines the “contract” between the client and the server, specifying how they should interact. The client makes a request following specific rules (usually called endpoints and methods), and the server responds according to these rules, providing the data or taking some action.

## Characteristics

**Communication Between Systems**: APIs allow two different systems to communicate and exchange data, even if they are written in different languages ​​or are on different platforms.

*Example*: A weather forecast application uses an API to fetch data from a server about the current weather in a given city.

**Clear Addressing**: APIs generally expose endpoints, which are clear URLs that represent services or resources.

*Example*: https://api.weather.com/cidade/sao-paulo – This endpoint can provide information about the weather in São Paulo.

**Multiple Uses**: APIs can be used for different purposes:
    - Data APIs: To search, create, update or delete data in an application.
    - Service APIs: To request the execution of a service, such as payment processing.

**Response Format**: API responses typically come in standardized formats such as JSON or XML, making it easier to understand and process information between different systems.

## Types of APIs

**Web APIs**: Use the internet to allow communication between systems (generally using HTTP).
- REST
- SOAP
- GraphQL
- gRPC
- WebSockets

**Operating System APIs**: Allow applications to interact with the operating system.

*Example*: Windows or Android APIs.

**Library APIs**: They are provided by software libraries so that developers can use their functionalities.

*Example*: Library APIs like TensorFlow for machine learning.
