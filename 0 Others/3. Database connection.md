## SQL

SQL is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

## API

API is an interface that abstracts and facilitates this interaction, offering a simplified way of accessing data without exposing the complexity of the database.
It defines the methods or functions that can be called by other software applications to access and manipulate data.

## Front-end and backend

The **backend** is responsible for implementing the API. It defines the endpoints (API URLs), which are basically the access points for the operations that the frontend can perform, such as "get data", "send new data", "update" or "delete".

The **frontend** consumes the API created by the backend using operations such as "get product list", "add an item to cart", etc.
