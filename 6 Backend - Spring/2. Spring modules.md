## Spring modules

Spring is modular, so each module has specific responsibilities, but some concepts (such as IOC and Beans) are shared between modules with different levels of functionality.

Spring consists of several modules (eg spring-core, spring-context, spring-webmvc, etc.), each with a specific purpose. These modules are libraries that you add to your project via dependencies in `pom.xml` (if you use Maven). The basic features, such as Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection, are in the spring-core, while more advanced modules (such as Spring-Context) build on them, adding extra features.

**Modules**

* Spring Core - Core Functionality, Including Inversion Of Control and Dependency Injection;
* Spring Beans - Works in conjunction with spring Core to provide more detailed beans management support;
* Spring Context - Extension of Core and Beans, adding a richer and more practical layer to manage beans and the context of the application;
* Spring Web - Provides basic support for web applications, integrating spring with web technologies as servlets;
* Spring WebMVC - Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) standard to create complete web applications;
* Spring AOP - Adds support to aspect oriented programming (AOP);
* Spring JDBC - Simplifies access to JDBC databases;
* Spring ORM - Integrates Spring with Object Relational Mapping Frameworks (ORM) such as Hibernate and JPA;
