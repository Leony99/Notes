## Gradle

Gradle is a more modern and flexible build automation tool than Maven. Instead of XML, it uses groovy or kotlin based script language (called DSL - Domain-Specific Language), which makes it more expressive and powerful. The main file is `build.gradle`. Gradle adopts a "Convention Configuration" approach, offering greater freedom to customize the build process.
