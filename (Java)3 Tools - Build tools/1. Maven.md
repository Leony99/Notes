## Maven

Maven is a Build automation tool based on a declarative model. It uses a configuration file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model), written in XML, where you define the project facilities, plugins, configurations and the build process. Maven follows a "Convention on Configuration" approach, that is, it assumes patterns for project structure (such as where to place source code files and tests), but allows personalization.
