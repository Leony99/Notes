# Navigation

In Next.js, the navigation system was traditionally based on **Pages Router**, but in Next.js version 13 the framework introduced a new routing system called **App Router**, which is based on directories and offers a more modern and flexible way of create routes.

## Link component

The Link component is used to navigate between pages.

*Example:*

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link href="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```
