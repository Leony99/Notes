# Navigation

In Next.js, the navigation system was traditionally based on pages(Pages Router), but in Next.js version 13 the framework introduced a new routing system called App Router, which is based on directories and offers a more modern and flexible way of create routes.

## App Router (Version 13 or above)

Based on a new folder called 'app'. This new model offers more flexibility and new features. It is inspired by React Server Components and takes advantage of a more modern architecture, with better support for features such as:

- Hybrid rendering (client-side and server-side with server components)
- nested layouts
- streaming
- route segmentation.

## Pages Router

Until Next.js version 12 (and available as an option in version 13), the navigation system was based on the pages directory. Each file within this folder represented a route in the application.

## Link component

The Link component is used to navigate between pages.

*Example:*

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link href="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```
