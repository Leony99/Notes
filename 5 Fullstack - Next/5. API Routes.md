# API Routes

API routes in Next.js allow you to create backend APIs directly within your Next.js application. These routes provide an easy way to build server-side logic, such as handling requests, processing data, and interacting with databases, without the need for setting up an external server.

**App Router**

The endpoint route is defined in the `app/api` directory, a *folder* is used as the route, and the resquests are written in `route.ts` file.

*Example:*

- `app/api/users/route.ts` = route to `api/users` endpoint.
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` = route to `api/users/[id]` endpoint.
- `app/api/posts/route.ts` = route to `api/posts` endpoint.
- `app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts` = route to `api/posts/[id]` endpoint.

**Pages Router**

The endpoint route is defined in the `pages/api` directory, a *file* is used as the route, and the requests are written in the file.

*Example:*

- `pages/api/user.ts` = route to `api/user` endpoint.
- `pages/api/post/[id].ts` = route to `api/post/[id]` endpoint.
- `pages/api/car.ts` = route to `api/car` endpoint.
- `pages/api/car/[id].ts` = route to `api/car/[id]` endpoint.
