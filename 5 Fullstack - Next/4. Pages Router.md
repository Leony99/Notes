# Pages Router

Pages based routing.

## Routes

The pages directory is a folder that contains all the pages of your application.

*Example:*

- `pages/index.jsx` = route to `/`.
- `pages/about.jsx` = route to `/about`.
- `pages/about/team.jsx` = route for `/about/team`.

## Dynamic routes

Create dynamic routes by using '[parameter]' in the file name.

*Example:*

`pages/post/[id].jsx` - `post/1` | `post/2` | `post/3`

The parameter value can be acessed in the page by useRouter(). or data fetching functions.

```jsx
// pages/post/[id].jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <div>ID: {id}</div>;
};

export default Post;
```

## Data fetching

In Pages Router, Next.js offers specific functions for loading data, each with a distinct behavior:

- `getStaticProps`: Used to generate static pages at build time. The page is generated once and served to all users.
- `getStaticPaths`: Used together with `getStaticProps` to generate static dynamic pages, such as blog post pages. It defines which dynamic pages need to be pre-generated.
- `getServerSideProps`: Used to generate pages on the server side on each request. This ensures that the data is always up to date.
