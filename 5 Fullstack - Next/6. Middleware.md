# Middleware

Middleware is a function that is executed before the request is handled by the server. It can be used to modify the request, response, or both.
They provide powerful control over how you handle incoming requests. You can use middleware to rewrite URLs, protect routes with authentication, perform redirects, or manipulate requests and responses at the edge (before they reach the server or the client).

To create a middleware in Next.js, you add a `middleware.ts` file at the root of your project. The file name (middleware.js) is what Next.js recognizes as the middleware entry point.

*Example:*

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request) {
  // Logic: redirect to '/' if the path is '/about'
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/about') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## Middleware configuration

You can configure middleware using the config export, which allows you to:

- matcher: Specifies which routes the middleware applies to.
- regions: Allows you to specify where the middleware should run in terms of regions (for global performance optimization).
- runtime: You can set it to "edge" to explicitly indicate that this middleware should run at the Edge. But by default, middleware runs on the Edge in Next.js.

*Example:*

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/api/:path*', '/static/:path*'],
};
```
