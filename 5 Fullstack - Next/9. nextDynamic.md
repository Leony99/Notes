# next/dynamic

next/Dynamic is a Next.JS functionality that allows you to load components in a dynamic way, that is, only when they are needed. This is useful for improving application performance, reducing the initial size of Bundle JavaScript.

## Use

To use Next/Dynamic, import it and define the component you want to load dynamically:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'));

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <DynamicComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

## Options

Dynamic accepts a second argument, which is a configuration object. Here are some common options:

ssr: Defines if the component should be rendered on the server side (SSR). The default value is true.

```typescript
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'), {
  ssr: false,
});
```

loading: Allows you to define a loading component while the dynamic component is being loaded.

```typescript
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});
```

suspense (Experimental): enables the use of react suspense to manage the state of loading.

```typescript
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'), {
  suspense: true,
});
```
