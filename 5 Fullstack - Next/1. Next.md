# Next.js

Next.js is primarily known as a React-based framework for building server-rendered front-end applications, but it also offers powerful back-end features.

## Installation

**Create Next App:**

```console
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Edge Runtime

Next.js introduces the *Edge runtime*, which runs JavaScript functions directly at the edge of the network(processing responses almost in real time), as close to the client as possible. This improves latency and makes responses faster as the code runs on geographically distributed CDNs.

Edge Runtime differs from Node.js because it is lighter and optimized for fast and simple operations. It lacks full access to the file system (like fs) and certain Node.js functionality that could be slower.
